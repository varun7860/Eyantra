<center><img src="FrontEnd/diagram2.png" width="50%"></center>
<br/>
Our Project aims on solving one of the major problems faced by doctors, medical professionals and the common man alike that is the unavailability of medical supplies due to inefficiency of data management. We direct our project towards getting everyone accurate data at high speed while ensuring maximun ease of access for the simplest of users.

### Modules of the Project
 - **Python user interface for medical stores and hospitals**
	* All suppliers will register with a unique username and password which will be used to log into the system there after.
	* The system is used to input data into the main database, directly from an excel sheet, which auto sorts required columns and eliminates the futile data. 
 - **Web servers**
	* This module solely caters to the common man who wants to purchase medical supplies. 
	* Rather than searching multiple stores and increasing his risk of acquiring the COVID-19, he gets perfect information of availability and location of his medical supplies
	* The user browses to "COVID-19supplies.in", and enters the location and required supply which will auto filter all the stores in his range, and give him most optimal store location. 

## Usage
 - This decreases time of exposure of the general public with other people, decreasing the chance of acquiring COVID-19
 - It is a very efficient inventory management system for all medical stores
 - It automatically filters out the medical supplies unrelated to COVID-19 decreasing the computation time, giving the user faster responses.
